- Rise up for Climate Justice, Be the superhero you're meant to be!

## Long Description

This app includes information about climate change and how we as an individual can help tackle this challenge.
It tracks our carbon footprint and gives us suggestive ways to reduce the same as an individual. The app has a point system where we can earn points for various activities such as planting trees(50), using public transport(30), reducing food wastage(20), switching to LEDs(25), etc. 
Since we are making use of a point system, there is going to be a leaderboard where you can track your scores and compete with your friends to create a sustainable tomorrow.
We have also included the "Community" section where you can make meaningful connections and look out for various events happening in your locality!

## Solution Roadmap

We plan on including more ways to earn points like taking care of the plant(10), consuming less meat/dairy (10), saving water (20) and so much more.
We are also adding this option where you can donate excess food from festivals/celebrations to various shelters using our app hence eliminating food wastage.
Other ideas include creating events where we educate people on climate change and give them practical ways to help the planet.
